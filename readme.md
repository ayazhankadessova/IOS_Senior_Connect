3. Social Media 
* Learn how to use WhatsApp/Facebook/Instagram basics

4. IoT Integration 
* Integrate IoT functionalities to enhance user experience, such as smart home device controls
and health monitoring tools. Provide interactive tutorials on how to use common IoT devices, tailored for seniors.
