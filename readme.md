## How can we teach Digiotal Literacy to Elderly? (Brainstorming)


1. Smartphone Basics 
* 3-4 lessons on how to use a smartphone 
2. Digital Literacy 
* Watch 5 videos on how to stay safe online / Read 
* Answer quiz questions
* I will get videos from Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LElWqXi7Ag&list=PLcetZ6gSk9682A7ZAZq2s9IqB-y8Ng63e
3. Social Media 
* Learn how to use WhatsApp/Facebook/Instagram basics 
* Quizes
4. IoT Integration 
* Integrate IoT functionalities to enhance user experience, such as smart home device controls
and health monitoring tools. Provide interactive tutorials on how to use common IoT devices, tailored for seniors.

## Bugs:

- Important

## Middle: Functionality
- [ ] EventRow cant show properly Registered/Not -> fix how it is updated => [Low Priority]

## Easy: Functionality
- [x] When u just open Events page => show some events
- [ ] Add pagination => [Infinite scroll] => [Low priority]

## Easy: Better UI
- [x] Lesson description -> align left

## Idk: from logs:

```
nw_read_request_report [C3] Receive failed with error "Operation timed out"

```
- When scroll events [High Priority] => no need to init stuff for every events
```
