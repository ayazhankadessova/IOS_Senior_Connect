1. Smartphone Basics 
* 3-4 lessons on how to use a smartphone 
2. Digital Literacy 
* Watch 5 videos on how to stay safe online / Read 
* Answer quiz questions
* I will get videos from Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LElWqXi7Ag&list=PLcetZ6gSk9682A7ZAZq2s9IqB-y8Ng63e
3. Social Media 
* Learn how to use WhatsApp/Facebook/Instagram basics

4. IoT Integration 
* Integrate IoT functionalities to enhance user experience, such as smart home device controls
and health monitoring tools. Provide interactive tutorials on how to use common IoT devices, tailored for seniors.

The Senior Connect app aims to facilitate social connections and improve digital literacy among seniors aged 60 and above. The app will serve as a platform for community engagement, mentorship, and resource sharing.
A calendar feature to promote workshops and activities for seniors. RSVP functionality allowing users to join events easily.

I am now working on the events tab. Help me create a few events. Event should have name, description, quota, address, organizer, category (educational, fun, smth like that), and anything else? 
* Events.
We need to CRUD Events.
Admin should create, edit, delete events. (no frontend for this, just do it via Postman haha)
Users should be able to: 
- see events in given date range, bc there is calendar 
- Join events (check quota and if event is not in the past). If successfuly joined event, add it to userInfo in events array, as well as in the event object, which will have list of participants.
- Unjoin events. Remove event from userInfo and from event





Backlog:
- [ ] Make quick actions workable
- [ ] Your Learning Progress for every category ?
- [ ] Make Detail View look good like in drafts
- [ ] go thru the code, remove lengthy views!
- [ ] Add image for vidoes, can we show them in the same page ?



Ideas:
1. Add offline support?
